# Ultimate Fight Predictor Front End
BE AWARE that this only works when I'm running my home server(Most of the time I'm not running it.)

## Features
- Use my [Tapology parser](https://github.com/angel-721/tapology-python-parser) to gather fighter information
- Use the [UFP Model](https://github.com/angel-721/UFP) to predict the outcome of fights
- Save outcomes for future trainning of mma machine learning models

## RoadMap
- Convert this to a wails application so that others don't have to rely on me running my server
